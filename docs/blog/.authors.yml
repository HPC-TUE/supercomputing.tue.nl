    name: Frederico Toschi
    description: Federico Toschi is full professor at the departments of Applied Physics and of Mathematics and Computer Science at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). His research focuses on the emerging complexity in challenging multi-scale problems at the crossroad between statistical physics, fluid mechanics, soft condensed matter and bio-physics. How do small-scale interactions and forces lead to large-scale complexity and chaos? How to analytically and numerically model complex flow problems? Federico’s research employs experimental, numerical and theoretical methods and covers -amongst others- fluid dynamics turbulence; lagrangian turbulence; thermal convection; complex fluids; soft condensed matter; active matter; crowd dynamics; scientific computing and Lattice Boltzmann methods.
