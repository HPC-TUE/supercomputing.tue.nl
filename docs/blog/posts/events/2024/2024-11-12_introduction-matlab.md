# Introduction to MATLAB on HPC Systems

This one-day workshop offers a hands-on introduction to submitting parallel computing jobs with MATLAB on the Dutch national supercomputer, Snellius. You’ll also get a brief overview of how to use MATLAB on the SURF Research Cloud. Throughout the day, you’ll learn to solve compute- and data-intensive problems by leveraging the cluster’s multicore processors and GPUs, access the SURF HPC cluster, configure and submit MATLAB jobs, and retrieve your results seamlessly.

<!-- more -->

By working through practical examples of parallelizing MATLAB algorithms, you'll gain valuable insights into parallel computing on HPC clusters and learn best practices. MathWorks experts will be available to review your MATLAB code and offer suggestions for optimization.

### Skills

- Optimizing your MATLAB code by utilizing multiple cores
- Scaling up your computations: GPU and Cluster computing
- Working with big data in MATLAB
- Accessing MATLAB on the Dutch national supercomputer Snellius

## Target audience

This course is aimed at students and researchers in the Netherlands and abroad. Anyone who meets the prerequisites is welcome to apply, including intermediate MATLAB users, Master’s and PhD students, postdocs, and other scientists.

##### Selection criteria
The number of participants for this workshop is limited. Applicants will be selected based on their experience, qualifications and scientific interest as indicated on the registration form. Please provide some motivation in the registration form for a convenient evaluation. Selected participants will be informed via email shortly after a successful registration.

## Pre-requisites

- University student (or higher) in a scientific domain
- Experience in MATLAB programming or parallel computing
- Good knowledge of English

##### Strongly suggested

Attendees are strongly encouraged to attend the [MathWorks online webinar](https://www.mathworks.com/company/events/seminars/parallel-computing-with-matlab-4569100.html){target=_blank} on Parallel Computing. This will give you the basic knowledge of parallel computing in MATLAB which you will require to fully take advantage of this workshop.
