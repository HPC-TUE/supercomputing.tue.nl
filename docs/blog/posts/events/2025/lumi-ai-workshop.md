# LUMI AI Workshop

**The TU/e Supercomputing Center is pleased to promote the upcoming “Moving Your AI Training Jobs to LUMI: A Hands-On
Workshop”, taking place May 27–28, 2025, in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.**

Organized by the LUMI User Support Team (LUST), in collaboration with EuroCC National Competence Centers in Finland and
the Netherlands, and GreenNLP, this two-day event is aimed at users who want to transition their AI workloads from
laptops, workstations, or cloud VMs to the powerful GPU-enabled LUMI supercomputer.

### What to Expect

The workshop will focus on adapting and running AI training jobs on LUMI-G. Participants will gain hands-on experience
with SLURM, ROCm, the Lustre/LUMI-O file systems, and the Slingshot 11 interconnect. The program also covers the use of
existing AI containers, building custom ones with the **cotainr** tool, and scaling training workloads across GPUs and
nodes.

Attendees are encouraged to bring their own AI training scripts to tailor for the LUMI environment. This is a unique
opportunity to receive direct support in optimizing your workflows for Europe’s fastest supercomputer.

### Participation Options

The workshop is free of charge. In-person participation (limited to 30 people) includes full access to lectures and
exercises. Lectures will also be streamed online, though hands-on support is only available to those attending in
person.

Coffee, tea, and snacks are provided. Participants are responsible for their own lunches and must bring their own
laptops.

### Prerequisites

Attendees should have basic experience with:

- **Working on a Linux command line**
- Using Python and one or more of the Python AI frameworks PyTorch, Tensorflow, or JAX
- Training an AI model on at least a single GPU, e.g. using a laptop, workstation, or cloud service
- Managing Python environments, e.g. using the Conda and/or pip package managers

Participants are expected to bring an own laptop to the workshop, including a charger.
