# On-Premises RAG LLM Hosting with NVIDIA AI Blueprint (SCC lunch session)

We invite you for a **hands-on lunch session** showcasing a fully operational **enterprise-level** RAG LLM deployment
running on your **own hardware**. This live demonstration will feature real document processing, interactive query
handling, and comprehensive visibility into system architecture and performance monitoring. Please also feel free to
share this opportunity with colleagues interested in private LLM hosting and implementation strategies (We can set this
up for your team **within half a day**! As long as you have the GPUs).

_Interactive demonstration with lunch provided!_ Researchers are also welcome to join! We look forward to your feedback.
