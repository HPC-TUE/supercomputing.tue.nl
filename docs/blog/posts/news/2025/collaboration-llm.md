# Open LLMs for Transparent AI in Europe

**Europe's leading AI companies and research institutions combine their forces and expertise to develop next-generation
open-source language models in an unprecedented collaboration to advance European AI capabilities, the [OpenEuroLLM
project](https://openeurollm.eu/){:target=_blank}.**

A consortium of **20 leading European research institutions**, companies and EuroHPC centres coordinated by Jan Hajič (
[Charles University](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/){:target=_blank}, Czechia) and co-led by Peter Sarlin 
([AMD Silo AI](https://www.silo.ai/){:target=_blank}, Finland) will build a family of performant,
multilingual, large language foundation models for commercial, industrial and public services.

The **transparent and compliant open-source models** will democratize access to high-quality AI technologies and 
strengthen the ability of European companies to compete on a global market and public organizations to produce impactful 
public services.

The OpenEuroLLM project is aligned with the imperative to improve Europe’s competitiveness and digital sovereignty. The
project is a prime example of the type of technology infrastructure needed to lower thresholds for European AI product
development and refinement, demonstrating the strength of transparency, openness and community involvement, values
largely recognized across the European tech ecosystem.

The models will be developed within Europe's robust regulatory framework, ensuring alignment with European values while
maintaining technological excellence. Cooperating with open-source and open science communities like 
[LAION](https://laion.ai/){:target=_blank}, open-sci and [OpenML](https://openml.org/){:target=_blank}, and additional 
experts in the field assembled in the project’s Open Strategic Partnership Board, OpenEuroLLM will ensure that the 
models, software, data and evaluation will be fully open and can be fine-tuned and instruction-tuned for specific 
industry and public sector needs. These performant multilingual models preserve both linguistic and cultural diversity, 
enabling European companies to develop high-quality products and services in the era of AI.

The project, which has been awarded the STEP (Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform) seal, leverages support from
previous European projects and the experience of the partners and their results, including large repositories of
high-quality data and pilot LLMs developed previously. The consortium commences its work on February 1st, 2025, with
funding from the European Commission under the Digital Europe Programme.
