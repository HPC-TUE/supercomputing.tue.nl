# MATLAB and Toolboxes now available on Snellius

We are happy to announce that after 2 years of conversations with MathWorks and SURF that MATLAB (and all toolboxes,
plus Simulink) are available on Snellius, the national supercomputer. Last week we had our first hands-on workshop
around this, in collaboration with SURF and MathWorks.

Please note that for both options (using MATLAB on Snellius, or on a local HPC cluster) no extra costs are involved. All
of this is included in your campus-wide license. May any questions remain, feel free
to [contact](../../../../contact.md) us.
