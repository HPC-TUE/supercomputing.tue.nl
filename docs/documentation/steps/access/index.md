# Access the cluster

The TU/e Umbrella HPC Cluster operates on a Linux platform that can be accessed via the command line or
through [web access](https://hpc.tue.nl). To log in, users typically utilize SSH to connect to the Login Nodes, which
are computers specifically designated for those wishing to access the HPC Cluster. This connection is restricted to
users within the university or facility network. To connect from an external location, you'll need to configure a VPN 
connection. Detailed instructions on setting up the VPN are available on the 
[intranet](https://tuenl.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet-LIS/SitePages/New-VPN-Service--eduVPN.aspx){:target=_blank}.

Once connected, users can interact with the system and execute small programs to test the system or software.

There are currently two methods to connect to the TU/e HPC Umbrella Cluster: either through a graphical user
interface/website using [Open Ondemand](openondemand.md) ^(recommended)^ or via the [SSH/Command Line](ssh/index.md).
