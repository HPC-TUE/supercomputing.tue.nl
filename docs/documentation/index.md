## Introduction

This section is intended for researchers at TU/e who desire computational power and are therefore open to explore HPC as a possible solution to executing their computationally intensive tasks.

## Quickstart

### Request Access

[Create a Service Request :material-ticket:](https://tue.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=a745121fa0ab45f2b24aaaf64060760f){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

### Use the Web Interface (Open OnDemand)

[TU/e Umbrella HPC Cluster web access](https://hpc.tue.nl)

## Glossary

As some basic understanding of computers and computer programming is assumed, the reader is advised to read the glossary for clarification of frequently used terms and definitions.

## Account

At the TU/e, some departments/research groups have several local computation facilities. These groups of computers are managed centrally, so you can get access with your TU/e account. Depending on your department/research group, you can get access to certain compute clusters. Request an account to use the TU/e HPC service sending an e-mail to the contact person of your department listed in the TU/e intranet, or submit a Topdesk ticket here. This person also may help you with questions about HPC.
