# Umbrella HPC Documentation

![The Umbrella Cluster](../assets/images/hpc-umbrella.png){ align=right width=175 }

The TU/e Umbrella HPC Cluster is the HPC cluster of the TU/e consisting of departmental supplied compute (CPU and GPU)
resources and managed by the Supercomputing Center Infra Team. It's one of the High Performance Computing solutions the TU/e Supercomputing Center offers.

As the TU/e Umbrella HPC Cluster is managed centrally, you can get access with your TU/e account. Depending on your
department/research group, you can get access to certain part of TU/e Umbrella HPC Cluster.

Feel free to contribute by providing content and/or correcting mistakes as this documentation is intended as a
collaborative platform.
You can do this by clicking on the edit button (:material-pencil:) in the top right corner on every page or visit our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HPC-TUE/supercomputing.tue.nl){:target=_blank}.
All TU/e employees and students can contribute, provided the information is TU/e HPC specific (refer to online guides for more generic HPC information where possible)!

!!! info "Local Clusters"

    Note that at the TU/e, some departments/research groups have several local computation facilities.
    These are **_not_** part of the TU/e HPC Umbrella Cluster,
    please contact the [Reasearch IT contact of your department](https://tuenl.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet-LIS/SitePages/Research-IT.aspx){:target=_blank} for more information.
