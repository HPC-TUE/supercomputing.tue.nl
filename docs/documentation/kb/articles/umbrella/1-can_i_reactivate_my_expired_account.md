# Can I reactivate my expired account?

You can reactivate your expired account by creating
a [support ticket](https://tue.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=a745121fa0ab45f2b24aaaf64060760f){:target=_blank}. 
While reactivation is always possible, please note that once an account expires, it may be deleted and
its data could potentially be lost. This means that when you reactivate, you might need to start with a new account
without any of the previous data.
