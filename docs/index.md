Computation has become an indispensable part of scientific research. A lot of computations can be performed on your
laptop or workstation. But more and more, big computational work requires much more professional methods, tools and
equipment.

At the TU/e Supercomputing Center (SCC) we help you perform such big computations fast and easy with advice, hands-on
support and dispatch to appropriate infrastructures. This may be advice on what infrastructure suits you best, hands-on
help in you optimizing your code, or even simply getting bureaucratic or financial hurdles out of the way.
