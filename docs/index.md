Do you need to make big computations for your research or educational work? Like, more than 12 hours of computation time
on your laptop or workstation? And are you struggling or spending too much time? Then, likely there is a faster, easier
solution.

Maybe the TU/e HPC Lab can help!

So, wait no longer and call us for speeding up your computations in Simulation and AI! We can be reached through e-mail
at **[supercomputing@tue.nl](mailto:supercomputing@tue.nl)** or phone at **[(040 247) 2010](tel:+31402472010)**. Or you
can visit us at
the [EAISI institute](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/institutes/eindhoven-artificial-intelligence-systems-institute){ target=_blank } in the EAISI office (Neuron building, room 1.105) at TU/e Campus.
