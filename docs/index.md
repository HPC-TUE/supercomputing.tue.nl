Computation has become an integral part of scientific research. A lot of computations can be performed on your laptop or
workstation. But more and more, big computational work requires much more professional methods, tools and equipment.

At the TU/e Supercomputing Center (SCC) we help you perform big computations fast and easy. We help you with consulting,
hands-on support and dispatch to appropriate infrastructures. This may be advice on what infrastructure suits you best,
hands-on help with optimizing your code, finding the right compute infrastructure for your workload, or even simply
getting bureaucratic or financial hurdles out of the way.
