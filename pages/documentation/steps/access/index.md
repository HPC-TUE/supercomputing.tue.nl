# Access the cluster

The TU/e Umbrella HPC Cluster is an UNIX-based (Linux) environment with shell (commandline) access.
To log in, one usually uses SSH to reach the respective Login Nodes (computers reserved for people just like you that want to connect to the HPC Cluster). This access is restricted, so you can only connect, when you are within the university/facility and its network. To still access the Login Nodes externally, one can 'pretend to be inside the network' by using the TU/e provided Virtual Private Network (VPN).
 
Once there, the user can interact with the system and run (small) programs to generally test the system/software.

There are currently two options to connect to the TU/e HPC Umbrella Cluster. Either by using a GUI/Website via [Open Ondemand](openondemand.md) ^(suggested)^ or through [SSH/Command Line](ssh.md).

## Personal homedir

All HPC accounts come with a
[homedir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory) on the cluster.

This directory ("folder" in Ms. Windows terminology) forms the entry
point "location" on the cluster for a user to operate the HPC cluster
from.

It can be used to store scripts but also to have (personal) software
locally installed and/or configured.
