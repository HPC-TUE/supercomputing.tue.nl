The TU/e Umbrella HPC Cluster is the HPC cluster of the TU/e consisting of Faculty supplied compute (CPU and GPU) resources and managed by the HPC Lab. It's one of the High Performance Computing solutions the HPC Lab offers.

As the TU/e Umbrella HPC Cluster is managed centrally, you can get access with your TU/e account. Depending on your department/research group, you can get access to certain part of TU/e Umbrella HPC Cluster.

!!! note "Local Clusters"
    Note that at the TU/e, some departments/research groups have several local computation facilities. These are **_not_** part of the TU/e HPC Umbrella Cluster, please contact the [Reasearch IT contact of your department](https://tuenl.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet-LIS/SitePages/Research-IT.aspx){:target=_blank} for more information.

!!! warning "Compass"
    Some users refer to this cluster with the _old_ name `Compass`. Additional documentation for this department/group can be found on their [wiki pages](http://tps.phys.tue.nl/tpswiki/index.php/Main_Page){:target=_blank}.
